# Markov Decision Process (MDP) Analysis Report

## Introduction
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in environments with stochastic outcomes. This report analyzes the given MDP case and presents insights into its structure, policy iteration, and value iteration processes.

## MDP Components
### States (S)
- Low Wealth (L)
- Medium Wealth (M)
- High Wealth (H)

### Actions (A)
- Conservative (C)
- Aggressive (A)

### Transition Probabilities
| Current State | Action | Next State Probabilities |
|--------------|--------|-------------------------|
| Low (L)      | C      | 80% Stay in L, 20% Move to M |
| Low (L)      | A      | 60% Stay in L, 40% Move to M |
| Medium (M)   | C      | 70% Stay in M, 30% Move to H |
| Medium (M)   | A      | 50% Stay in M, 50% Move to H |
| High (H)     | C      | 90% Stay in H, 10% Drop to M |
| High (H)     | A      | 70% Stay in H, 30% Drop to M |

### Rewards
- Conservative action (C) provides a stable but lower reward.
- Aggressive action (A) provides higher potential rewards but also carries more risk.

## Policy and Value Iteration
The Value Iteration algorithm updates the expected utility for each state until convergence. Policy Iteration, in contrast, iterates between evaluating the current policy and improving it based on the maximum expected reward.

## Case Analysis
1. **Risk vs. Reward Tradeoff**: The aggressive approach (A) provides a higher chance of moving to High Wealth (H) but also increases the risk of losing wealth.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: Depending on the discount factor and initial wealth state, a mixed strategy combining both C and A might be ideal.
3. **Long-Term Implications**: Over multiple iterations, the policy stabilizes towards an optimal strategy that maximizes long-term rewards.

## Conclusion
The MDP model presented effectively captures decision-making in financial investments. The optimal policy derived depends on balancing risk and reward, with long-term value maximization being the key goal.
